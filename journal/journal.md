Kimsooja (2016). Archive of Mind. Accessed April 19, 2020. http://www.kimsooja.com/projects_2016_MMCA_Archive-of-Mind.html#

Archive of Mind is a participatory installation that builds over the course of the exhibition. Through the collaboration of audience to form a lump of clay into spheres at a 19-meter-long elliptical wooden table, which doubles as a canvas. I am inspired by the concept of participatory installation, without the audience participation this work would not have acheived its outcome.

Karina Smigla-Bobinski (2010). ADA. Accessed April 19, 2020. https://www.smigla-bobinski.com/english/works/ADA/

ADA is a giant interactive analogue installation, featuring a huge helium balloon studded with charcoal spikes, which create patterns on the surrounding white walls. Similar to the first project, I am inspired by the idea of audience participation for the creation of the final artwork. I like that this was something simple, charcoal to paper.

Aharon Ozery (2012). Freeze. Accessed April 19, 2020. http://www.art.org.il/5/artist/aharon-ozery?en

I am inspired by the drawing mechanics, the simplicity of representing the biometric data collected.

David Bynoe (2013). Four Cable Drawing Machine. Accessed April 19 2020. http://dbynoe.blogspot.com/2013/12/four-cable-drawing-machine.html

I am inspired by the organic pattern drawn in the sand as the circular interface is being moved around in a controlled and regulated motion.

*CYMATICS: SCIENCE VS MUSIC* by Nigel Stanford

Certain frequencies vibrate the metal plate in such a way that it creates areas where there is no vibration. The sand and water vibrates and creates beautiful geometric patterns and effects. As the frequency increases in pitch the patterns become more complex. This inspired me to explore the various interface methods such as vibration and pressure.

*Particle Flow* by Neoanalog

Granules are driven by gravity and topography forming an analogue particle system. A moving slanted plane and a grid of motorized stamps control the elements to form infinite variations of behaviors and patterns. This is what I aspire the future developement of the project to be (in terms of scale), as well as the smoothness of the mechanics of the concept that I am envisioning.

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
An artistic representation of stress and destress as recorded by the biometric data.

### Design ideation ###
### Design concept 1: Emotional Cube ###
![Image of Design Concept Sketch 1](/Images/DCS1.jpg)

*Drawing is not propotionate to size, the cube propose in the ideation process is visualised to be at least 300x300x300 (mm).

An LED cube with heart rate sensors on wristbands. This is an LED cube that vibrate, buzzes and flashes colour when there is a change to the heart rate of the user. The purpose of this emotional cube is to indicate a change in heart rate, signifying the possibility of distress. This could be used in a situation where the user have problem communicating their feelings â€“ for example, pets, babies etc. This however, would require some research to be conducted. Standard, average heart rate should be determined and programmed accordingly. This design concept would be a visual and auditorial representation of distress.

### Design Concept 2: Tension Wrist Cuffs ###
A heart rate sensing wristband (Wristband) and a receiver inflatable wrist cuff (Wrist Cuff). The inflatable wrist cuff is design to tighten with when the pulse sensing wristband reads an increased pulse rate from the resting heart rate. The higher the read, the tighter the cuffs. The purpose of this tension wristband is to indicate body distress of the wearer of the wristband. This design concept would be a tacticle representation of distress. 

### Design Concept 3: Activation Fidget Cube ###
![Image of Design Concept Sketch 3](/Images/DCS3.jpg)

*Drawing is not propotionate to size, the fidget cube propose in the ideation process is visualised to be at least 30x30x30 (mm). Actual interface design to be determined.

This fidget cube controls the x and y axis of the pen plotter. The 6 faces of the cube will have a variation of touch sensitive trigger points, the point of activation will trigger the pen plotter moving in accordance to the directional movement of the set interface creating a distress inspired drawing. This design concept would be a visual representation of distress.

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this code. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->


## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel. This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
