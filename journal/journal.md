Archive of Mind is a participatory installation that builds over the course of the exhibition. Through the collaboration of audience to form a lump of clay into spheres at a 19-meter-long elliptical wooden table, which doubles as a canvas. I am inspired by the concept of participatory installation, without the audience participation this work would not have acheived its outcome.

ADA is a giant interactive analogue installation, featuring a huge helium balloon studded with charcoal spikes, which create patterns on the surrounding white walls. Similar to the first project, I am inspired by the idea of audience participation for the creation of the final artwork. I like that this was something simple, charcoal to paper.

Certain frequencies vibrate the metal plate in such a way that it creates areas where there is no vibration. The sand and water vibrates and creates beautiful geometric patterns and effects. As the frequency increases in pitch the patterns become more complex. This inspired me to explore the various interface methods such as vibration and pressure.

Granules are driven by gravity and topography forming an analogue particle system. A moving slanted plane and a grid of motorized stamps control the elements to form infinite variations of behaviors and patterns. This is what I aspire the future developement of the project to be (in terms of scale), as well as the smoothness of the mechanics of the concept that I am envisioning.

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
An artistic representation of stress and destress as recorded by the biometric data.

### Design ideation ###
### Design concept 1: Emotional Cube ###
![Image of Design Concept Sketch 1](/journal/Photos/DCS1.jpg)

*Drawing is not propotionate to size, the cube propose in the ideation process is visualised to be at least 300x300x300 (mm).

An LED cube with heart rate sensors on wristbands. This is an LED cube that vibrate, buzzes and flashes colour when there is a change to the heart rate of the user. The purpose of this emotional cube is to indicate a change in heart rate, signifying the possibility of distress. This could be used in a situation where the user have problem communicating their feelings – for example, pets, babies etc. This however, would require some research to be conducted. Standard, average heart rate should be determined and programmed accordingly. This design concept would be a visual and auditorial representation of distress.

### Design Concept 2: Tension Wrist Cuffs ###
A heart rate sensing wristband (Wristband) and a receiver inflatable wrist cuff (Wrist Cuff). The inflatable wrist cuff is design to tighten with when the pulse sensing wristband reads an increased pulse rate from the resting heart rate. The higher the read, the tighter the cuffs. The purpose of this tension wristband is to indicate body distress of the wearer of the wristband. This design concept would be a tacticle representation of distress. 

### Design Concept 3: Activation Fidget Cube ###
![Image of Design Concept Sketch 3](/journal/Photos/DCS3.jpg)

*Drawing is not propotionate to size, the fidget cube propose in the ideation process is visualised to be at least 30x30x30 (mm). Actual interface design to be determined.

This fidget cube controls the x and y axis of the pen plotter. The 6 faces of the cube will have a variation of touch sensitive trigger points, the point of activation will trigger the pen plotter moving in accordance to the directional movement of the set interface creating a distress inspired drawing. This design concept would be a visual representation of distress.

### Final design concept: *Stress Painter* ###
![Image of Design Concept Sketch 4](/journal/Photos/DCS4.jpg)

**Initial concept: Heart Rate Sensors**

A heart rate controlled drawing machine that translate the heart rate by plotting pen to paper. The purpose of this design concept is to capture and artistic representation of stress and distress. 

After some research, it might be too hard for me to use heart rate/pulse as the chosen biofeedback. The parts required to make this concept work requires Arduino and would require some time to learn (personally). I have decided that it might be better to come up with an alternative rather than learning a whole new program. 

**Current concept: Pressure Sensor**

Using pressure to control the drawing machine. Fulfils the same purpose but have more flexibility when it comes to prototyping. The current design concept utilises a stress ball to trigger the servo motors with extensions. When the interface is held and/or squeezed, the data will be translated to the servo motors to extend and retract. This extension motion will push the suspended drawing platform allowing the painting ball to move around the canvas organically. The purpose of this design concept is to capture the artistic representation of stress and distress of the user, hence the stress ball interface.

**Main Components (required/as thought of in ideation):**
* Motors: <a href="https://www.jaycar.com.au/servo-motor-standard-6-volt-with-metal-gear-11kg/p/YM2765">Servo Motor</a> | <a href="">Stepper Motor</a>
*	Different variation of drawing based on the different range of pressure
*	Current medium is paint and paper. (Paint covered ball) 
*	Shape of the stress “ball” to be determined (based on what works best with the chosen pressure sensor)

A couple of things that might be figured out as we progress along in the prototyping phase. There is a variety of ways to measure the pressure (will have to determine which is the best way, to be updated):
* Plotting the analog pin pressure-sensitive sensor 
* Flex sensor 
* Thin-Film Pressure Sensor 
* Force Sensitive Resistor

*Flex Sensor and Servo Test + Flex Sensor code to read value in order to map low and high values*

*Stress Painter* took various phases of experimentation. While waiting on the arrival of the flex sensor, I have tested the pins, codes, servos and the mechanics of the circuit. As there were parts used in the set up that I am unfamiliar with, it took a lot of testing and experimentation to figure out the codes and wirings. While testing the mechanics initially, I have used a 9G Micro Servo Motor. With the envisioned scale of the model, it is predicted that the micro servo would not be able to handle the weight. Hence, I have bought a stronger servo motor as depicted in the photo. Once the flex sensor has arrived, I have integrated the interface into the circuit. It took some experimenting to figure out the best circuit configuration as well as the rotating angles to map the servo blades to.

*<a href="https://vimeo.com/422424203">Flex Sensor + Micro Servo Test</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/422424262">Flex Sensor + Servo Motor Test</a> and Circuit Test*

After connecting the servo motor in place of the micro servo, more issues had surfaced. As the servo motor required more power to function, I have initially bought an external 5v power breadboard to supply more voltage to the circuit. The servo motor was only working for a short period of time and it mysteriously stopped functioning. After days of troubleshooting, the circuit was still not working, and I have fried my Microbit at that point. (There was tears…) After some consultation with David, we have figured out two major issue. The external 5v circuit breadboard had created a broken circuit on the breadboard that we still can’t figure out why. And that I had inherited a bunch of broken wires which was why it was hard to isolate the problem.

*<a href="https://vimeo.com/422424325">Recreating Scott Russell Mechanicsm</a>*

The next phase of experimentation was figuring out materials and a suitable mechanic for the servo motor to control. Due to the restrictions, I am unable to use the laser cutter in the university to cut wood materials. In this case, I have decided to use cheap and malleable materials—crafting popsicle sticks, balsa wood, foam boards and clay—to build the model. In the envisioned concept, the model needed an upward force to move the canvas base. After researching on various vertical mechanic, I have decided to adopt the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIr1PM-aCYA">*Scott Russell Mechanism*</a>. The *Scott Russell Mechanism* gives a theoretically linear motion by using a linkage form with three portions of the links all equal and a rolling or sliding connection, creating a right-angle change of motion.

Crafted from a pack of popsicle sticks, the first frame was too weak and hence the decision was made to double the framework in order to support the weight of the vertical prongs. 

<img src="https://github.com/angelagoh/7515QCA-Assessment3/blob/master/journal/Photos/13interfacetesting.jpg" width=290px><img src="https://github.com/angelagoh/7515QCA-Assessment3/blob/master/journal/Photos/14interfacewithmechanics.jpg" width=290px>

As mentioned in the design concept above, the interface for this project was a kneading(stress) ball. Stress balls can simply be made with cornflour, water and a balloon, however in order to achieve the right consistency a fair bit of experimentation was required to achieve the perfect viscosity. The mixture needed to “feel right” and it needed to have the right consistency to support the flex sensor within. Preference to the measurement of mixture can vary individually however I have gone with 1 cup of cornflour to 1/4 cup of warm water.

<img src="https://github.com/angelagoh/7515QCA-Assessment3/blob/master/journal/Photos/IMG_5189.jpeg" width=290px/><img src="https://github.com/angelagoh/7515QCA-Assessment3/blob/master/journal/Photos/IMG_5192.jpeg" width=290px/>

With the uncertainty of the circuit and the instability of the connection of the flex sensor, troubleshooting as we fit every piece together was the last phase of experimentation. There were a lot of reinforcements made to the model as the materials were malleable but not sturdy enough in its earlier state to support the weight and force created by the rotating servo motor. The strength of the servo had to be weighed down in order to counter the force of the rotating motor (I have sacrificed some Jenga blocks). I have hot glued the mechanics to the servo blade to ensure secure movement, however, the additional weight and force has frozen the motor. It was then that I decided to attach the mechanics by woven wires, releasing the extra tension created by the hot glue. As the flex sensor is being bent within the interface the servo motor rotates about its position within the mapped angles, triggering the crafted Scott Russell Mechanics to enable the vertical movement of the prods. This movement then triggers the canvas base and paint-covered ball, allowing it to organically capture the “stress movements”.

## Final code ##

## Design process discussion ##
This concept was developed to capture the artistic representation of the stress and/or distress of an individual. I have identified this opportunity through my partner that suffers from mild anxiety. With this concept, I would like to inspire him to look at things with a 'glass half full'attitude and see that there are beauty in all things. We realised that he is more prone to having an episode when placed under an immense amount of stress, and with that emotion he get figety and uneasy. Hence the decision of creating a stress ball, and in order to withstand the kneading action I have decided to go with a flex sensor to be integrated as the interface. Research and experimentation was the key to creating the test circuit. However, troubleshooting and editing the model as I progress was what makes the prototype successful.

## Reflection ##
It has been a very interesting and inspiring project that I never thought to have accomplished. My background in art and design played to my strength when conceptualising the idea and design. I was instantly inspired by the various artistic mechanics and installation concept to as show in the initial reaseach.

The biggest difficulty that I had when making this prototype was that I had zero knowledge on codes and mechanics. This meant that I had to do a lot of research on both aspects of the project, as well as the additional long hours of experimenting to achieve the final outcome of the project. Youtube was the most used platform for me to listen and see how different people connect the different types of parts and circuits together. However, one of the issue that I have noticed was that we have very limited tutorial content when it comes to Microbit as compared to its counterparts such as Arduino or RasberryPi. It took a lot of trial and error in codes and circuit connection in order for the flex sensor to work with the servo motor. It was also interesting to learn that I had fried the MicroBit simply because i have connected the live and signal wires incorrectly. As mentioned in the documentation process above, I had inherited a bunch of broken wires. For future reference, it would be best for me to do a simple LED light test with all my wires prior to starting any project.

*Stress Painter* was conceptualised to capture the artistic representation of stress as felt by an individual. I believe that the "painting" mechanics in my project are the novel components. I would like to further develop this design by improving on the material choices. The integration of stronger, sturdier materials would allow for a bigger build and I can further experiment with the addition of various elements such as; shape and number of the painting medium, colour choices, as well as the material of the canvas base. All in all, I believe that I have crafted this prototype to the best of my abilities given the current circumstances and I would like to be able to develop this project with right materials when the time comes.
