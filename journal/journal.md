Kimsooja (2016). Archive of Mind. Accessed April 19, 2020. http://www.kimsooja.com/projects_2016_MMCA_Archive-of-Mind.html#

Archive of Mind is a participatory installation that builds over the course of the exhibition. Through the collaboration of audience to form a lump of clay into spheres at a 19-meter-long elliptical wooden table, which doubles as a canvas. I am inspired by the concept of participatory installation, without the audience participation this work would not have acheived its outcome.

ADA is a giant interactive analogue installation, featuring a huge helium balloon studded with charcoal spikes, which create patterns on the surrounding white walls. Similar to the first project, I am inspired by the idea of audience participation for the creation of the final artwork. I like that this was something simple, charcoal to paper.

David Bynoe (2013). Four Cable Drawing Machine. Accessed April 19 2020. http://dbynoe.blogspot.com/2013/12/four-cable-drawing-machine.html

I am inspired by the organic pattern drawn in the sand as the circular interface is being moved around in a controlled and regulated motion.

*CYMATICS: SCIENCE VS MUSIC* by Nigel Stanford

Certain frequencies vibrate the metal plate in such a way that it creates areas where there is no vibration. The sand and water vibrates and creates beautiful geometric patterns and effects. As the frequency increases in pitch the patterns become more complex. This inspired me to explore the various interface methods such as vibration and pressure.

*Particle Flow* by Neoanalog

Granules are driven by gravity and topography forming an analogue particle system. A moving slanted plane and a grid of motorized stamps control the elements to form infinite variations of behaviors and patterns. This is what I aspire the future developement of the project to be (in terms of scale), as well as the smoothness of the mechanics of the concept that I am envisioning.

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
An artistic representation of stress and destress as recorded by the biometric data.

### Design ideation ###
### Design concept 1: Emotional Cube ###
![Image of Design Concept Sketch 1](/journal/Photos/DCS1.jpg)

*Drawing is not propotionate to size, the cube propose in the ideation process is visualised to be at least 300x300x300 (mm).

An LED cube with heart rate sensors on wristbands. This is an LED cube that vibrate, buzzes and flashes colour when there is a change to the heart rate of the user. The purpose of this emotional cube is to indicate a change in heart rate, signifying the possibility of distress. This could be used in a situation where the user have problem communicating their feelings â€“ for example, pets, babies etc. This however, would require some research to be conducted. Standard, average heart rate should be determined and programmed accordingly. This design concept would be a visual and auditorial representation of distress.

### Design Concept 2: Tension Wrist Cuffs ###
A heart rate sensing wristband (Wristband) and a receiver inflatable wrist cuff (Wrist Cuff). The inflatable wrist cuff is design to tighten with when the pulse sensing wristband reads an increased pulse rate from the resting heart rate. The higher the read, the tighter the cuffs. The purpose of this tension wristband is to indicate body distress of the wearer of the wristband. This design concept would be a tacticle representation of distress. 

### Design Concept 3: Activation Fidget Cube ###
![Image of Design Concept Sketch 3](/journal/Photos/DCS3.jpg)

*Drawing is not propotionate to size, the fidget cube propose in the ideation process is visualised to be at least 30x30x30 (mm). Actual interface design to be determined.

This fidget cube controls the x and y axis of the pen plotter. The 6 faces of the cube will have a variation of touch sensitive trigger points, the point of activation will trigger the pen plotter moving in accordance to the directional movement of the set interface creating a distress inspired drawing. This design concept would be a visual representation of distress.

## Final code ##

## Design process discussion ##
This concept was developed to capture the artistic representation of the stress and/or distress of an individual. I have identified this opportunity through my partner that suffers from mild anxiety. With this concept, I would like to inspire him to look at things with a 'glass half full'attitude and see that there are beauty in all things. We realised that he is more prone to having an episode when placed under an immense amount of stress, and with that emotion he get figety and uneasy. Hence the decision of creating a stress ball, and in order to withstand the kneading action I have decided to go with a flex sensor to be integrated as the interface. Research and experimentation was the key to creating the test circuit. However, troubleshooting and editing the model as I progress was what makes the prototype successful.

## Reflection ##
It has been a very interesting and inspiring project that I never thought to have accomplished. My background in art and design played to my strength when conceptualising the idea and design. I was instantly inspired by the various artistic mechanics and installation concept to as show in the initial reaseach.

The biggest difficulty that I had when making this prototype was that I had zero knowledge on codes and mechanics. This meant that I had to do a lot of research on both aspects of the project, as well as the additional long hours of experimenting to achieve the final outcome of the project. Youtube was the most used platform for me to listen and see how different people connect the different types of parts and circuits together. However, one of the issue that I have noticed was that we have very limited tutorial content when it comes to Microbit as compared to its counterparts such as Arduino or RasberryPi. It took a lot of trial and error in codes and circuit connection in order for the flex sensor to work with the servo motor. It was also interesting to learn that I had fried the MicroBit simply because i have connected the live and signal wires incorrectly. As mentioned in the documentation process above, I had inherited a bunch of broken wires. For future reference, it would be best for me to do a simple LED light test with all my wires prior to starting any project. 

*Stress Painter* was conceptualised to capture the artistic representation of stress as felt by an individual. I believe that the "painting" mechanics in my project are the novel components. I would like to further develop this design by improving on the material choices. The integration of stronger, sturdier materials would allow for a bigger build and I can further experiment with the addition of various elements such as; shape and number of the painting medium, colour choices, as well as the material of the canvas base. All in all, I believe that I have crafted this prototype to the best of my abilities given the current circumstances and I would like to be able to develop this project with right materials when the time comes.
